The game is played on two 10x10
grids. The grids are identified in 
columns and rows by order. On one 
grid, you arrange your battleships 
and records of shots by the 
opponent while the other grid
is used to record your own shots.

Before the gameplay, you have 
to arrange your ships 
on the grid. 5 ships occupy a number
of squares on the grid, standing 
either horizontally or vertically.
Ships are not allowed to overlap.

After ships have been positioned, 
the game starts. The screen shows 
two grids on the screen. The left 
grid show the position of your
arrangement of ships and records 
of the AI’s shots while the right
one records your shots.

In each round, each player takes 
a turn to shoot a target square into
the opponent's grid. If it is a 
"hit", an O is ticked in that square 
and the attacking player has a 
continuing turn to take a shot, he 
can continue to shot until he misses. 
If it is a "miss", an X is ticked in 
that square and turning to the 
opponents'turn. When a ship is shot 
down, all the square that are occupied by 
it are high-lighted in order that 
the attacking player will not shoot 
the same square a second time.

The game will proceed in a series of
rounds until all ships of a player
are sunk, then their opponent wins.
